First join:

select * from customer inner join payment
on customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id limit 10;


customer has the PK and payment has the FK

I am joining the customer onto the payment table

This query shows you the first 10 records of customers matched with their payments. Customers without payments are excluded.The tables arenâ€™t merged permanently.

The query joins them together on the fly to show you a combined view.
